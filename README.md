# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Overview:
In this unit, coders will create the classic game of tic tac toe in their browser! The user will input moves as player X or O on a tic tac toe board. When a player wins, the game will end and a message will display the winner.

## Day 1

#### Planning
- [ ] Complete the project planning document.
#### Set-Up
- [x] Go to the repository
- [x] Fork this repository to your github account and import into a new Glitch project
- [ ] Make your site live on gh-pages
- [x] Submit your website using the link on the Agenda

### JavaScript
- [ ] Declare a variable that keeps track of the current player and set it equal to either a string of "X" or "O"
- [ ] Declare a variable that keeps track of the total number of turns taken and set it equal to 0
- [ ] Declare a variable of a boolean type that will signal whether or not the game has ended and set it equal to false
- [ ] Declare a function called with two parameters that removes the button of the corresponding ID, and changes the text of the div that is the tileId to the player variable.
- [ ] Declare a function with 0 parameters that will change the current player to either "X" or "O" depending on the current player. Decide where to call this function.

#### Wrap
- [ ] Save and submit your website using the link on the session agenda.

## Day 2

### JavaScript
- [ ] Declare a function with 3 parameters of the tileIds, and return if the value of the each of the tileIds are equal to the current player. This function will check if the player has won.
- [ ] Declare a function that will call the function above on all of the vertical combinations of tiles.
- [ ] Declare a function that will call the function above on all of the horizontal combinations of tiles
- [ ] Declare a function checkDiagonalWins that will call the function above on all of the diagonal combinations

## Day 3

### JavaScript
- [ ] Implement behavior that will change the title to "It's a draw!" and end the game by changing the boolean variable to true after 9 pieces are placed. Do this by writing a function that will add 1 to the current turns, and check if that counter has reached 9.
- [ ] In each of the win functions, if the win condition is satisfied, set the end game variable to true, and change the title to "[Player] Wins!"
- [ ] Update your functions to check if the game has ended first before placing a piece.
- [ ] Determine the appropriate location to place the Win functions

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Project Extensions:
- [ ] Add in your own css to personalize your project
- [ ] Create a button that will reset the game back to the original (this requires clearing the Xs and Os, and putting the "move" buttons back)
- [ ] Keep track of the score between the two players: X wins, O wins, and draws
- [ ] Change the 9 button functions to instead be one generic function on the button selector
- [ ] Change the board to be 4x4 and end the game when there is a 4 in a row
